      <h4>Top 5 Reasons I Have More Passion for Web Development than Electrical Work:</h4>

      <ol class="list-inside">
        <li>No more raging on I-35 every day</li>
        <li>Significantly lower risks of electrocution, blowing my back out, or getting squished by a Bobcat</li>
        <li>The opportunity to work with more people who are more skillful than me and who are into stuff besides ice hockey and pole barns</li>
        <li>The potential to exercise critical thinking skills while solving problems, perhaps even creating something new someday that's not "by the book"</li>
        <li>As I get older, it's more & more difficult after a hard day of physical labor to enjoy my other passions, which include: <!-- I want to make 'passions' blue here, too, but I need to keep going and leave this for now -->
