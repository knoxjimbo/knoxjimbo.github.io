    <p>According to my <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> mentor Walter G. in a recent <a href="https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/11407/why-every-developer-needs-a-tech-blog-in-2021">article</a> on his slick site <a href="https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/">thatsoftwaredude.com</a>, “Whether you are just getting started with a programming language and a tech stack, or if you have 10 years of experience already and building complex scalable apps, you need to have a blog.”  After reading his article, I agreed, and began work on this blog.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as my blogging platform for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coding a blog from scratch would be too hard</li>
  <li>Using a WYSIWYG editor like Blogger would be too easy</li>
  <li>Jekyll is just right
    <ul>
      <li>I can write posts in Markdown on any text editor</li>
      <li>I can edit HTML &amp; CSS source code, with default themes serving as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolding</a> for me to improve my skills</li>
      <li>All files exist in a local repo, and Jekyll can serve my site locally with live reload, so I can see how changes to source code affect my site in real-time</li>
      <li>Free, integrated web hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, with custom domain name</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That said, the process of installing prerequisite programs (Ruby, RubyGems, &amp; Bundler), installing Jekyll, creating a default site, &amp; pushing my local repo to GitHub was <em>waaaaaay</em> harder than I thought it would be and worthy of its own post.</p>
