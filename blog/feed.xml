&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; as my blogging platform for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding a blog from scratch would be too hard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a WYSIWYG editor like Blogger would be too easy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll is just right
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I can write posts in Markdown on any text editor&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I can edit HTML &amp;amp; CSS source code, with default themes serving as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding&quot;&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; for me to improve my skills&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All files exist in a local repo, and Jekyll can serve my site locally with live reload, so I can see how changes to source code affect my site in real-time&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Free, integrated web hosting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, with custom domain name&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the process of installing prerequisite programs (Ruby, RubyGems, &amp;amp; Bundler), installing Jekyll, creating a default site, &amp;amp; pushing my local repo to GitHub was &lt;em&gt;waaaaaay&lt;/em&gt; harder than I thought it would be and worthy of its own post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="post-0" /><summary type="html">According to my Thinkful mentor Walter G. in a recent article on his slick site thatsoftwaredude.com, “Whether you are just getting started with a programming language and a tech stack, or if you have 10 years of experience already and building complex scalable apps, you need to have a blog.” After reading his article, I agreed, and began work on this blog.</summary></entry></feed>
